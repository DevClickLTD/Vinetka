      "whatTypeDescription": "There are six types of vignettes: daily, weekend, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual. The electronic system makes the purchase easier, as vignettes can be bought in person and online.",
      "howToBuyDescription": "You can purchase an electronic vignette here or through the National Toll Administraton's official website or via one of its official partners, including gas stations, bank branches, post offices, and mobile applications.\n\nAll you need is the registration number of the vehicle and the country of registration.\n\nMake sure the vehicle data you enter is correct before you purchase, as the system does not allow for corrections after activation.",
